# F010: Export Reports

## Goal

Keep export reports reliable.

## Vision Anchor

- Original request or source: test fixture.
- User pain point or engineering problem: exports regress after completion.
- Desired outcome: patch history is visible and reviewable.
- Non-goals or boundaries: no new export subsystem.
- Exit Gate source: this Feature page.

## Feature Intake

- Original problem: export reliability needs a durable owner.
- User pain point: completed exports can regress without attribution.
- Capability promise: export regressions are tracked through this Feature.
- Non-goals: no new export subsystem.
- Acceptance source: this Feature page.
- Open questions: none.

## Capability Contract

- Export report behavior has a durable recovery and patch attribution entrypoint.

## Decision Context

### Why

Export behavior needs a durable owner because regressions can appear after completion.

### Why Not

Do not create a new Feature for each export regression because patch attribution belongs to the owning Feature.

### If Modifying This Area, Check

- Check linked Evidence and Patch History before changing export behavior.

## Current Status

Active.

## Links

### Evidence

- Final response or linked Evidence.

### Decisions / ADRs

- None.

### Lessons

- None.

### Specs / Plans

- None.

### Related Features

- None.

### External Context

- None.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Export regressions are tracked.

## Acceptance Map

| Claim | Acceptance | Evidence | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Export regressions are tracked | Patch history rows identify follow-up fixes | Final response or linked Evidence | active |

## State Timeline

| Date | State | Trigger | Evidence | Note |

| 2026-05-18 | active | test fixture | Final response | Initial state |

## Patch History

## Evidence

Final response or linked Evidence.

## Recovery Snapshot

- Read first: this Feature page.
- Current capability state: active test fixture.
- Known risks: none.
- Next safe action: continue only after gate checks pass.
- Unblock condition: not blocked.

## Next Step

Continue only after gate checks pass.

# LL-010: Export Report Protection

## Case

Export report validation failed after a completed workflow changed.

## Resolution

The report validation path was stabilized and documented.

## Pitfall

Do not treat repeated export report failures as unrelated local bugs.

## Root Cause

The owning Feature and prior validation evidence were not checked first.

## Protection

Run the owning Feature retrieval and linked Evidence checks before changing export report behavior.

## Source

Final response or linked Evidence.

## Principle

Repeated failures should be attributed before patching.

## Context

A durable test decision needs a recoverable rationale.

## Decision

Use the accepted test decision.

## Decision Boundary

### Applies To

- Test ADR validation fixtures.

### Does Not Apply To

- Production runtime behavior.

## Rejected Options

- Keep the old structure: rejected because it does not capture decision boundaries.

## Consequences

Future readers can see the accepted tradeoff and its cost.

## Before Changing This Decision

Check the linked Feature, Evidence, validator expectations, and affected ADR docs.

Final response or linked Evidence.
