# EV-008: Session Recovery Hooks

## Supports Claim

This Evidence supports the completion or validation claim for EV-008: Session Recovery Hooks.


## Verification Scope
Verified F005: the optional Harness hook runner now supports `pre-compact` and `session-start`, writes same-session recovery snapshots under `.harness/session-recovery/by-session/`, updates `latest.md` only for manual inspection, exposes Claude Code and Codex `SessionStart` additional context with the platform hook output shape, injects OpenCode compaction context through `output.context`, keeps Codex `PreCompact` broad enough to run on observed context compaction events, avoids cross-session recovery injection, and preserves the no-default-`PostToolUse` constraint.

F005.4 adds a diagnostic guardrail because real Codex Desktop sessions can record `compacted/context_compacted` without observable Harness `PreCompact` execution or recovery artifacts. The diagnostic distinguishes runner writability from platform lifecycle proof.

F005.5 adds hook runtime trace, root-level plus nested Codex `hooks.json`, Codex hook feature-gate checks, and removes unproven Codex command working-directory assumptions from the example config after Codex Settings showed all three Harness hooks but no session produced observable `Stop`, `PreCompact`, or `SessionStart` execution.

F005.6 corrects the OpenCode Stop adapter after checking the current `@opencode-ai/plugin` `1.15.13` contract. `experimental.session.compacting` remains a direct trigger hook with `output.context`, but `session.idle` is a global SDK event and must be handled through the plugin `event(input)` hook. Because the idle event only carries `sessionID`, the adapter now fetches recent session messages through the OpenCode SDK and passes the latest assistant text to Harness as `last_assistant_message`.

F005.7 corrects the Codex Windows command boundary after real UI evidence showed every Harness hook exiting with `code 1`. The failing command shape was reproduced by running the old `commandWindows` value through PowerShell: `%PLUGIN_ROOT%` was not expanded and the wrapper never started. The fix wraps each Windows command in `cmd /d /s /c`, preserving `%PLUGIN_ROOT%` expansion and `.cmd` execution even when Codex launches hooks through PowerShell.

- F005.5 targeted hook tests: 21 tests passed, including runtime trace and Codex wrapper command assertions.
- F005.5 manual wrapper smoke: command returned `{}` for Codex allow output and wrote `.harness/hook-events/events.jsonl` into the temporary payload `cwd`.
- F005.6 targeted OpenCode hook tests: 5 tests passed after confirming the new regression tests first failed against the direct `"session.idle"` hook key and missing session-message fetch.
- F005.7 regression test first failed with `Unexpected token 'session-start'` when PowerShell executed the old `"%PLUGIN_ROOT%\hooks\run-harness-hook.cmd" session-start` command.
- F005.7 targeted regression test passed after wrapping Windows commands with `cmd /d /s /c`.
- F005.7 targeted suite passed: `python -m unittest tests.test_harness_hook tests.test_skill_progressive_disclosure tests.test_hook_diagnostics` ran 42 tests with OK.
- F005.7 installed cache smoke passed: SessionStart, PreCompact, and Stop `commandWindows` values all returned exit code 0 when executed through PowerShell with `PLUGIN_ROOT` set to the installed `Harness@personal` cache.

## Limitations

This Evidence does not prove behavior outside the verification scope recorded above.

## Notes
Session recovery is runtime context, not canonical Harness memory. The automatic injection snapshot is intentionally written under `.harness/session-recovery/by-session/<session_id>.md` so only the same session can recover from compaction. `.harness/session-recovery/latest.md` remains a manual inspection pointer and must not be injected into unrelated new sessions.

The follow-up learning from F005.1 is captured in [LL-005 Session Recovery Must Be Session-Scoped](../lessons/LL-005-session-recovery-must-be-session-scoped.md).

The follow-up learning from F005.2 is captured in [LL-006 Platform Hooks Must Use Native Context Channels](../lessons/LL-006-platform-hooks-native-context-channels.md).

The OpenCode example intentionally does not use `session.created` for automatic recovery. It handles `experimental.session.compacting(input, output)`, writes a same-session snapshot with `pre-compact`, reads that same-session snapshot through `session-start` with `source=compact`, and pushes recovered context into OpenCode's native `output.context` channel.

The F005.3 Codex follow-up came from a real `E:\Self-Project\Multi-Agent-Assi` session where the session log contained `compacted/context_compacted` but no `.harness/session-recovery/` file. Codex `PreCompact` now uses an empty matcher so compaction variants are not missed; `SessionStart` remains `compact`-scoped to prevent unrelated startup pollution.

The F005.4 Codex follow-up came from a later new Codex Desktop session in `E:\Work-Project\OtherWork\ScienceClaw` where the session log again contained `compacted/context_compacted` but no `.harness/session-recovery/` file. Manual runner smoke succeeded in that project root, so the protection moved from another matcher patch to a diagnostic that reports platform lifecycle evidence gaps.

The F005.5 Codex follow-up came from the same machine after Codex Settings displayed `Stop`, `PreCompact`, and `SessionStart`, while session logs and project runtime files still showed no hook execution. Local evidence showed Codex trusted `hooks/hooks.json`, while plugin examples also show root-level `hooks.json`; later comparison with Superpowers and Codex docs showed the missing user-level hook feature gates and the need for Windows-specific command expansion. The adapter now includes both config locations, routes commands through `hooks/run-harness-hook.cmd`, uses `commandWindows` with `%PLUGIN_ROOT%`, and writes `.harness/hook-events/events.jsonl` on actual runner execution.

The F005.7 Codex follow-up came from local Codex Desktop UI showing `hook exited with code 1` for every Harness hook. Manual reproduction showed the runner and wrapper returned 0 when invoked directly, but the exact old `commandWindows` string returned 1 under PowerShell. The corrected config now uses `cmd /d /s /c ""%PLUGIN_ROOT%\hooks\run-harness-hook.cmd" <event>"`, and the installed personal plugin source plus cache were updated on the local machine.

The F005.6 OpenCode follow-up came from rechecking the current official plugin contract on 2026-06-03. The npm type definition exposes `event(input)` for global events and direct trigger hooks for names such as `experimental.session.compacting`; the SDK event union includes `session.idle`, but the plugin `Hooks` interface does not expose `"session.idle"` as a direct hook key. The SDK also exposes `client.session.messages({ path: { id }, query: { directory, limit } })`, so the example now filters `input.event.type` inside `event(input)`, reads recent messages for that session, and sends the latest assistant text to the normalized `stop` runner.
