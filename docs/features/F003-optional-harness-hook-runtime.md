# F003: Optional Harness Hook Runtime

## Goal

Add an optional hook runtime for Harness so Codex, Claude Code, and OpenCode can run deterministic checks after Harness artifact edits and before completion claims, while the existing Skill-only installation remains fully usable when hook configuration fails or is disabled.

## Vision Anchor

- Original request or source: The user approved evolving Harness from Skill-only prompt constraints toward a Skill + Hook plugin shape.
- User pain point or engineering problem: Harness Skills can tell agents what to do, but agents may still use completion language before a valid closeout block.
- Desired outcome: First slice provides hard `Stop` completion checks backed by existing `using-harness/scripts/` validators, with fail-open behavior for hook installation/runtime errors. PostToolUse remains available only as an explicit experiment, not a default hook.
- Non-goals or boundaries: Do not replace Harness Skills, do not encode Start Gate or ADR judgment in hook logic, and do not make hook installation a prerequisite for installing or using Skills.
- Exit Gate source: This Feature page, hook runner tests, updated install docs, and the final verification output.

## Feature Intake

- Original problem: See `## Vision Anchor` original request or source.
- User pain point: See `## Vision Anchor` user pain point or engineering problem.
- Capability promise: Preserve the capability described by `## Goal` and `## Acceptance Criteria`.
- Non-goals: See `## Vision Anchor` non-goals or boundaries.
- Acceptance source: This Feature page and linked Evidence.
- Open questions: none recorded for this completed Feature.

## Capability Contract

- The completed capability boundary is defined by `## Goal`, `## Vision Anchor`, and `## Acceptance Criteria`; detailed proof stays in linked Evidence.

## Decision Context

### Why

Hook runtime 可以提升恢复和 closeout 自动化，但必须保持可选，避免 broken hook 阻断正常 Skill 使用。

### Why Not

没有把 Start Gate、Vision Gate 或 Feature ownership 判断移入 deterministic hook，因为这些判断需要上下文和语义裁量。

### If Modifying This Area, Check

- 检查 hook examples、hook diagnostics 和 install docs 是否同步。
- 确认 hook failure 仍然 fail open，除非 completion boundary 已被明确证明失败。

## Current Status

Done. The optional hook runtime is bundled under `skills/using-harness/hooks/`, tested, and documented as an enhancement that does not replace Skills-only installation. F015 narrows the default hook surface to Stop-only completion-claim checking; session recovery hooks are no longer a current capability.

### External Context

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Default hook examples do not wire `PostToolUse`; the runner keeps `post-tool-use` only as an explicit experimental mode.
- [x] `Stop` hook behavior detects completion claims and blocks or continues when the final message lacks a structurally valid Harness closeout block.
- [x] Hook runner failures caused by missing hook dependencies, missing docs roots, or platform JSON differences fail open with a warning instead of breaking Skill-only workflows.
- [x] Hook resources are bundled under `skills/using-harness/` so Skill installation owns the script resources and hook installation can remain optional.
- [x] Installation documentation explains Basic install as Skills-only and Enhanced install as Skills + Hooks for Codex, Claude Code, and OpenCode.
- [x] Default hook examples are narrowed to Stop-only completion-claim checking; session recovery hooks are historical and superseded by F015.

## Evidence

- [EV-006 Optional Harness Hook Runtime](../evidence/EV-006-optional-harness-hook-runtime.md)
- [EV-022 Stop Only Hook Runtime](../evidence/EV-022-stop-only-hook-runtime.md)

## Recovery Snapshot

- Read first: this Feature page, then linked Evidence.
- Current capability state: completed; current default hook surface is Stop-only.
- Known risks: none recorded beyond `## Patch History`.
- Next safe action: follow `## Next Step`; record any delivered-behavior follow-up in `## Patch History`.
- Unblock condition: not blocked.

## Next Step

Use the Stop hook in local plugin trials for Codex, Claude Code, and OpenCode before tightening platform-specific adapters.
